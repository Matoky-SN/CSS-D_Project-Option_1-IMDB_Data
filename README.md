# IMDB Movie Data analysis
A practical test to apply newly aquired coding and Python skills and knowledges to extract specific insights from a moderately large dataset.

## Introduction
This project's goal is to gather some information from film related data. For example, information about : Christopher Nolan movies and movie ratings.

## Cleaning and Analysis
Before the analysis, some columns have missing values and it would be best to either fill or drop, where appropriate, those missing values to prevent a bias.

In this case the missing values were filled in with the average value of the column where the missing values were located, to not get incorrect answers to some of the questions bellow.

The analysis is guided by the following questions and the code is written to answer them :

  1- What is the highest rated movie in the dataset?
  
  2- What is the average revenue of all movies in the dataset?
  
  3- What is the average revenue of movies from 2015 to 2017 in the dataset?
  
  4- How many movies were released in the year 2016?
  
  5- How many movies were directed by Christopher Nolan?
  
  6- How many movies in the dataset have a rating of at least 8.0?
  
  7- What is the median rating of movies directed by Christopher Nolan?
  
  8- Find the year with the highest average rating.
  
  9- What is the percentage increase in number of movies made between 2006 and 2016?
  
  10- Find the most common actor in all the movies. Note, the "Actors" column has multiple actors names. You must find a way to search for the most common actor in all the movies.
  
  11- How many unique genres are there in the dataset? Note, the "Genre" column has multiple genres per movie. You must find a way to identify them individually.

## Usage
This project highlights the usefulness of pandas and data analysis in the movie industry as it enables people in these fields to determine valuable information from a large dataset fairly easily.

For instance, it showcases the movie with the highest rating, and with further analysis could help determine the director with the highest average revenue, the average runtime with the highest average revenue, the movie with the highest metascore.

These information then help the people from the industry make educated decisions for their future projects, like for example which director to hire for a successful movie.

The answers were obtained with the use of Python and the pandas library, so to make a similar analysis, you need to have the pandas library installed and work on the csv file provided in the repository or use a similar file.

You can use this code as a way to answer similar questions or as a starting point to answer more complex questions. It can be used with datasets from other industries as well, as long as the file has a similar look to the provided csv file.

## Contribution
I am new to this and this is my first project so I don't really know what I expect but feel free to contribute, submit pull requests or open issues.
